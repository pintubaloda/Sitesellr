Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Onboarding Wizard UI	Developed	Added missing header menu (Features/Modules/Pricing/Resources) on onboarding right header and applied 10-20px micro-spacing/font/button/input refinements for closer visual match and more professional compact appearance.	One final live screenshot check can still be done for exact device/browser rendering differences.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	Flow unchanged and correct: Register -> Verify OTP(email+mobile) -> Choose Plan -> Payment(if paid) -> Setup Store -> Activate -> redirect admin.	Real payment gateway integration still pending.
RBAC + Tenancy	Developed	Two-layer RBAC and tenancy guard updates remain active from previous commits.	Audit logs + step-up auth for high-risk actions pending.
