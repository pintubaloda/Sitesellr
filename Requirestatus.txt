Updated: 2026-02-17 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders.
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Product/Customer/Order create+update+delete API wiring done end-to-end.

New in this update
- Added backend store update endpoint: `PUT /api/stores/{id}` with owner/admin policy + tenancy checks.
- Wired Settings General tab save button to backend store update API.
- Added save status feedback on Settings page.
- Backend build verified successful (`dotnet build`) with warnings only.

Pending / Partial
