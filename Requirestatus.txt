Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
User/Merchant Partial Completion	Developed	Implemented partial-completion items for User/Merchant domain: added Store Team management backend APIs and wired Settings->Team UI to real API (list/add/update role/remove). Added merchant status update API and wired Merchants UI status control.	Invitation email/accept flow, team audit logs, and richer merchant lifecycle tooling still pending.
Store Team Management	Developed	New endpoints: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/stores/{storeId}/team...` with tenancy + policy checks; UI now operates on real data using existing theme/fonts.	Custom role-name management UX and invitation token flow pending.
Merchant Lifecycle UI	Partial	Merchant list/create existed; now status update wired via `PUT /api/merchants/{id}` (Trial/Active/Suspended/Expired).	Bulk actions, suspend reason history, lifecycle audit trail pending.
