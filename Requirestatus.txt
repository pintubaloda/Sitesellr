Sitesellr Cumulative Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18

Requested Scope	Status	Developed Now	Remaining
Server-side validation + DTO tightening	Developed (this pass)	Tightened DTO validation with DataAnnotations and server checks for Merchant Ops, Team, Invites, and Role Templates APIs (invalid action/role/scope/department/status blocked, duplicate assignment checks, normalized permission CSV).	Apply same strict DTO validation pattern across older legacy endpoints not yet covered.
Migration files for governance tables	Developed (this pass)	Added idempotent EF migration `20260218142000_GovernanceTables` for merchant onboarding, role templates, sensitive approvals, franchise units/stores, and backoffice assignments.	Generate designer/snapshot via `dotnet ef` once .NET SDK is available in CI/dev environment.
Smoke-test checklist for new admin pages/APIs	Developed (this pass)	Added `SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST_ADMIN.md` covering Platform RBAC, Merchants, Merchant Ops, Team, Invite Acceptance, Role Templates, Audit Logs, and API negative validation checks.	Automate this checklist in integration/e2e pipeline.

Previous in-progress governance modules	Developed (core)	Lifecycle ops, onboarding profile, team invite/accept, role templates, approvals queue, franchise/backoffice workflows, and audit logging remain implemented and wired.	Production hardening: SMTP reliability, approval chains, immutable audit retention, enterprise permission builder UX.
