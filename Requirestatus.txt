Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Render/Container Runtime Warnings	Developed	Added forwarded headers support and made HTTPS redirection conditional (development or `FORCE_HTTPS_REDIRECT=true`) to prevent "Failed to determine https port" behind proxy/container ingress.	Set env vars correctly on Render (`ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:10000` or platform default).
Data Protection Config	Developed	Added optional `DATA_PROTECTION_KEYS_PATH` support so keys can be persisted to a mounted/shared path instead of container home profile path.	If no persistent disk/path is configured, key persistence warning can still appear after restarts.
Platform/Admin Modules	Developed	Platform RBAC UI + Merchants UI remain wired with unauthorized message handling.	Role seeding still required for access.
