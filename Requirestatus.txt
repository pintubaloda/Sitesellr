Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Platform RBAC Admin UI	Developed	Added admin page wired to real APIs for platform role management and store-user permission management (`GET/PUT /platform/rbac/...`).	Requires platform owner token/role assignment to use in production.
Merchants Management UI	Developed	Added admin page wired to real API (`GET /merchants`, `POST /merchants`) with create/list handling.	Edit/update/suspend UI actions can be added next (backend endpoints currently minimal).
Admin Navigation Wiring	Developed	Added sidebar and routes for `Merchants` and `Platform RBAC` modules under `/admin`.	None.
Single Register Entry	Developed	`/onboarding` continues to redirect to `/auth/register`.	None.
