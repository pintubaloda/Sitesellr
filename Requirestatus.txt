Updated: 2026-02-17 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders (+ CRUD wiring in admin).
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Settings General save updates store via backend API.

New in this update (Railway deploy readiness)
- Added Railway deployment runbook: `DEPLOY_RAILWAY.md`.
- Added frontend production Dockerfile: `frontend/Dockerfile`.
- Updated backend Dockerfile to bind Railway dynamic PORT using:
  - `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:${PORT:-5000}` at runtime entrypoint.

Pending / Partial
- Store email/phone/address fields are currently UI-only placeholders (not persisted in current store model).
