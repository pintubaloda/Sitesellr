Sitesellr Cumulative Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18

Requested Scope	Status	Developed Now	Remaining
Full merchant lifecycle management UI/actions	Developed (core)	Implemented Merchant Ops UI + API lifecycle actions: trial/activate/suspend/expire/reactivate with optional approval routing for sensitive actions.	Bulk lifecycle operations and reason taxonomy dashboards.
Merchant onboarding completion pipeline	Developed (operational core)	Added onboarding pipeline profile (email/mobile/KYC/ops/risk flags + pipeline status) with Merchant Ops UI + API update/load.	External verification providers and automated operational checks.
Team management module (invite/role/revoke/audit)	Developed (expanded)	Already wired team APIs expanded with invite/accept and audit; now role templates and template apply flow added via Settings Team UI and backend role-template APIs.	Email template branding/retry queue and revoke/resend flow hardening.
Franchise/back-office hierarchy + scoped access	Developed (core)	Added franchise unit and back-office assignment models + Merchant Ops UI/API create/list workflows.	Deeper hierarchy visuals and policy matrix per department.
Role template/custom role builder + sensitive approvals	Developed (core)	Added store role templates CRUD/apply APIs and UI builder (permissions CSV + sensitive flag); sensitive actions generate approval requests; Merchant Ops includes approval queue + approve action.	Rich permission picker UI (instead of CSV), multi-step approval chain.
Full audit logs for merchant/user admin changes	Developed (core)	Audit logs already capture merchant lifecycle/team changes; audit logs viewer UI with filters/export exists from prior update.	Broader event coverage and immutable retention controls.
