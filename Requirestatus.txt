Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-17 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders.
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Product/Customer/Order create+update+delete API wiring done end-to-end.
- Settings General save now updates store via backend API.

Document structure update
- Kept `masterrequirement.docx` for requirement/status matrix.
- Renamed duplicate `mainrequirementstatus.docx` to `release_checklist.docx`.
- `release_checklist.docx` now contains strict Owner/ETA/Risk/Priority release checklist.

Pending / Partial
- Store email/phone/address fields are currently UI-only placeholders (not persisted in current store model).
- Some advanced form fields are minimal for now (e.g., rich order item editing, full address management UI).
- Billing plan enforcement, real payment providers, WebAuthn UI flows, and production CSP/CORS/rate tuning remain pending.
- Full Shopify-level modules (theme marketplace, logistics integrations, plugin ecosystem, SaaS metering, etc.) remain pending.

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 1adb53a
