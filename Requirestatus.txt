Sitesellr Cumulative Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18

Requested Scope	Status	Developed Now	Remaining
Server-side validation + DTO tightening	Developed (this pass)	Tightened DTO validation with DataAnnotations and server checks for Merchant Ops, Team, Invites, and Role Templates APIs (invalid action/role/scope/department/status blocked, duplicate assignment checks, normalized permission CSV).	Apply same strict DTO validation pattern across older legacy endpoints not yet covered.
Migration files for governance tables	Developed (this pass)	Added idempotent EF migration `20260218142000_GovernanceTables` for merchant onboarding, role templates, sensitive approvals, franchise units/stores, and backoffice assignments.	Generate designer/snapshot via `dotnet ef` once .NET SDK is available in CI/dev environment.
Smoke-test checklist for new admin pages/APIs	Developed (this pass)	Added `SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST_ADMIN.md` covering Platform RBAC, Merchants, Merchant Ops, Team, Invite Acceptance, Role Templates, Audit Logs, and API negative validation checks.	Automate this checklist in integration/e2e pipeline.

Previous in-progress governance modules	Developed (core)	Lifecycle ops, onboarding profile, team invite/accept, role templates, approvals queue, franchise/backoffice workflows, and audit logging remain implemented and wired.	Production hardening: SMTP reliability, approval chains, immutable audit retention, enterprise permission builder UX.

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 0f4b927
- Current validation + migration + smoke-checklist changes are local and pending commit/push.

  - Added backend policy keys for high-risk capabilities (merchant suspend/delete, refund override, payout freeze/release, plans manage, security policies manage, plugin approve, API key revoke).
  - Added auth access payload enrichment: platform permissions + high-risk action map from `/api/auth/access`.
  - Added sensitive-action enforcement for platform RBAC writes: `reason` required and optional step-up guard via `REQUIRE_STEP_UP_FOR_SENSITIVE=true` with `X-Step-Up-Auth=true`.
  - Added sensitive action audit entries for RBAC updates and merchant approval flow actions.
  - Added platform owner permission catalog endpoint: `GET /api/platform/rbac/catalog/platform-owner`.
  - Updated admin sidebar scope behavior so platform owner no longer auto-sees store-only menus without store role context.
  - Updated Platform RBAC UI to send reason + optional step-up header for sensitive writes.
- Partial:
  - Step-up currently header-gated (`X-Step-Up-Auth`) and config-driven; not yet a full 2FA challenge handshake.

  - Dual approval workflow for high-risk actions.
  - Dedicated financial intervention endpoints with enforced policy-per-action + re-auth screens.
  - Immutable audit export/signing pipeline and approval reason taxonomy.

- Pending:
  - Theme lifecycle audit timeline view (who changed price/rank/status).

  - Full preview mode before apply enabled for store owner + platform owner via `previewThemeId` query flow.
- Partial:
  - Product listing UX is improved but still not a full dedicated PDP/PLP template engine.
  - Checkout is functional baseline; payment gateway handoff/3DS and advanced shipping/tax are pending.

  - `ContainsBlockedPremiumSection` now uses internal local variable and assigns `blockedKey` only after traversal success.
- Impact:
  - Resolves backend build failure seen in commits `68bfb62`, `e52bf32`, `032bf12`, `75afd72`, `b1f9fb7`, `6b10637`.

[2026-02-19 09:43 IST] Render crash hotfix (FormatException line 296)
- Fixed startup SQL format parsing failure in `Program.cs` by escaping JSON default braces for `ExecuteSqlRawAsync`.

[2026-02-19 10:18 IST] Role/Permission model alignment + test-user permission binding
- Developed:
  - Expanded permission catalog to align with requested platform/store/customer atomic permission model (merchant governance, finance, plugins, API keys, security, store ops, customer perms).
  - Added platform staff default permission bundle in tenancy resolver (scoped read/masked-style capabilities).
  - Updated store role bundles to permission-first templates (Store Admin and Store Staff bundles).
  - Bound seeded test users to permissions by role on startup (`SEED_TEST_USERS=true`) by syncing `store_user_permissions` for owner/admin/staff users.
  - Kept role as bundle source but no feature exposure hardcoded by role names in frontend access checks.
- Notes:
  - Platform owner/platform staff permission exposure is resolved from platform role bundle templates at runtime.
  - Customer test user remains storefront-only by design (no admin/store permissions seeded).

[2026-02-19 10:27 IST] Auth permissions debug endpoint
- Developed:
  - Added `GET /api/auth/permissions` for production/debug verification of logged-in user's effective permissions.
