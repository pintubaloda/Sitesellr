Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders (+ CRUD wiring in admin).
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Settings General save updates store via backend API.

New in this update (Render DB env hardening)
- Updated backend DB connection resolver in `Program.cs` to support multiple env keys:
  - `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `ConnectionStrings__Postgres` / `ConnectionStrings:Postgres`
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `RENDER_EXTERNAL_DATABASE_URL`
  - `RENDER_INTERNAL_DATABASE_URL`
- Added support to normalize `postgres://...` URLs into Npgsql connection string format.
- Added production safeguard: if resolved host is localhost, app fails fast with clear error message.

Pending / Partial
- Store email/phone/address fields are currently UI-only placeholders (not persisted in current store model).
- Some advanced form fields are minimal for now (rich order item editor, full address management UI).
- Billing plan enforcement, real payment providers, WebAuthn UI flows, and production CSP/CORS/rate tuning remain pending.
- Full Shopify-level modules (theme marketplace, logistics integrations, plugin ecosystem, SaaS metering, etc.) remain pending.

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 0c88abb
