Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-17 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver middleware and RBAC policies.
- Domain APIs: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders (list/get/create) with store-scoping and pagination.
- Security: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, CSRF middleware, security headers, Turnstile verify API on auth endpoints.
- Frontend wired to backend (without UI/theme redesign):
  - Auth pages call backend and persist opaque tokens.
  - Admin pages wired: Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings (store data), store switcher.
  - Protected admin route based on stored access token.
- Turnstile end-to-end now wired in frontend:
  - Cloudflare Turnstile widget rendered on Login and Register pages.
  - Captcha token passed to backend as `turnstile_token`.
  - Captcha failure clears token and forces re-challenge.
