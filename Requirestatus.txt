Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-17 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders.
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- CRUD update: product/customer/order create+update+delete API wiring done end-to-end.

New in this update
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI failure (`MSB1003`) caused by invalid desktop workflow template.
- Replaced workflow with backend .NET CI:
  - `.github/workflows/dotnet-ci.yml`
  - Runs restore/build/test in `backend-dotnet` project explicitly.
- Verified locally: `dotnet test backend-dotnet/backend-dotnet.csproj` exits successfully.

Pending / Partial
- Some advanced form fields are minimal for now (e.g., rich item editing in orders, full address management).
- Billing plan enforcement, real payment providers, WebAuthn UI flows, and production CSP/CORS/rate tuning remain pending.
- Full Shopify-level modules (theme marketplace, logistics integrations, plugin ecosystem, SaaS metering, etc.) remain pending.

Config
- Frontend Turnstile: REACT_APP_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
- Backend Turnstile: Turnstile__SecretKey
