Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Register vs Onboarding URL	Developed	Set single recommended page model: `/onboarding` now redirects to `/auth/register` so users always land on register wizard.	None.
Header/Menu	Developed	Default wizard header menu disabled (no Features/Modules/Pricing/Resources links) to keep focused auth experience.	None.
Right Panel Typography	Developed	Reduced right-panel heading/subheading to a cleaner professional scale (`46px`/`18px`) with tighter spacing.	Can still do tiny 5-10px final polish after latest live screenshot.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	5-step flow and redirect behavior unchanged.	Real payment gateway integration pending.
