Sitesellr Cumulative Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18

Module	Status	What was completed now	What remains
Real Invite Delivery	Developed (config-based)	Implemented backend email service for invite delivery via SMTP/provider config (`SMTP__Host/Port/Username/Password/From/UseSsl`). Team invite endpoint now attempts real email send and returns `emailSent` flag.	Provider templates, retry queue, bounce handling.
Invite / Accept Flow	Developed	Team invite create + accept flow is active (tokenized invite, password set on accept, role binding, sign-in tokens issued).	Optional revoke/resend endpoints.
Audit Logs Viewer	Developed	Added backend audit logs API (`GET /api/audit-logs` with filters/pagination) and admin Audit Logs UI with action/store/merchant filters + CSV export.	Advanced filters/date ranges + server-side export jobs.
User/Merchant Lifecycle Partials	Partial improved	Merchant status transitions and store lifecycle controls are wired in UI; team role management with custom role support is wired.	Full role-builder UX and approval workflows.
