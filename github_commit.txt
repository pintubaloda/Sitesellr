Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Onboarding Wizard UI	Developed	Adjusted onboarding page to closely match the new attached split-screen reference: full-height blue gradient left panel, branded hero/testimonial style block, right auth-form style canvas, refined spacing and font scale, and 5-step wizard rail with exact requested step labels/flow.	Final browser-level pixel QA still needed against your exact screen size and font rendering.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	Flow remains: Register -> Verify Email+Mobile OTP -> Choose Plan -> Payment (only if paid plan) -> Setup Store -> Activate + redirect admin.	Payment integration is still stubbed (no real gateway processing yet).
RBAC + Tenancy	Developed	Two-layer RBAC and tenant policy guards remain active from previous update.	Need audit logs and step-up auth for high-risk operations.
