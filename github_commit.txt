Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders (+ CRUD wiring in admin).
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Landing page Emergent branding removed from public entry.

New in this update (Onboarding flow v1)
- Added end-to-end onboarding APIs:
  - `POST /api/onboarding/start`
  - `POST /api/onboarding/verify-email`
  - `POST /api/onboarding/verify-mobile`
  - `GET /api/onboarding/plans`
  - `POST /api/onboarding/choose-plan`
  - `POST /api/onboarding/confirm-payment` (stub)
  - `POST /api/onboarding/setup-store`
  - `POST /api/onboarding/complete`
- Added frontend onboarding wizard page at `/onboarding` and linked Get Started CTA buttons to it.
- On completion, flow creates User + Merchant + Store + Owner role and signs user in with opaque tokens.
- Onboarding session storage uses in-memory concurrent dictionary (dev-safe, non-persistent).

Pending / Partial
- Email/SMS OTP providers are not integrated yet (currently on-screen OTP for dev only).
- Payment confirmation is stubbed; no real gateway capture in onboarding yet.
- Store setup wizard is minimal (no advanced business fields / Cloudflare provisioning automation yet).
- Billing plan enforcement, WebAuthn UI flows, and production CSP/CORS/rate tuning remain pending.
- Full Shopify-level modules (themes marketplace, logistics integrations, plugin ecosystem, SaaS metering, etc.) remain pending.
