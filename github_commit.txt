Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Register Page Wizard	Developed	`/auth/register` now uses the onboarding wizard layout and flow (same color/font style as latest wizard pass), matching your requested 5-step experience on the register URL.	Can still fine-tune tiny spacing per your next screenshot if needed.
Header Menu	Developed	Removed header menu on register wizard by disabling menu links for the register route while keeping clean auth header actions.	None.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	Flow unchanged: Register -> Verify OTP(email+mobile) -> Choose Plan -> Payment(if paid) -> Setup Store -> Activate -> redirect admin.	Real payment gateway integration still pending.

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 75bfc21
- Current register wizard mapping + header-menu removal is local and pending push.
