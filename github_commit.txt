Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Developed (latest working tree)
- Backend: .NET 8 API + PostgreSQL with tenancy resolver and RBAC policies.
- Core domain endpoints: merchants, stores, products, customers, orders (+ CRUD wiring in admin).
- Security baseline: opaque tokens, lockout/rate-limit, Turnstile verify on auth, CSRF middleware, security headers.
- Frontend wired to backend data without UI/theme redesign for Dashboard, Products, Customers, Orders, Settings.
- Turnstile widget integrated on Login/Register and enforced via backend verification.
- Settings General save updates store via backend API.

New in this update (Railway frontend dependency fix)
- Fixed frontend Docker build failure due to peer dependency conflict:
  - `react-day-picker@8.10.1` expects `date-fns ^2/^3`, while project uses `date-fns@4`.
- Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` install command to:
  - `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- This resolves Railway build error `ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree`.

Pending / Partial
- Proper long-term dependency alignment still pending (recommended: migrate `date-fns` to a version compatible with all peers or upgrade dependent packages).
- Store email/phone/address fields are currently UI-only placeholders (not persisted in current store model).
- Some advanced form fields are minimal for now (rich order item editor, full address management UI).
- Billing plan enforcement, real payment providers, WebAuthn UI flows, and production CSP/CORS/rate tuning remain pending.
- Full Shopify-level modules (theme marketplace, logistics integrations, plugin ecosystem, SaaS metering, etc.) remain pending.

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 9cfabad
- Current frontend dependency build fix is local and not pushed yet.
