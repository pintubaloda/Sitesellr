Backend-Frontend Wiring Check	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Auth + Onboarding	Wired	`/auth/register` wizard fully wired to real onboarding APIs (start/verify/plan/payment/setup/complete) and redirects to admin after activation.	None.
Core CRUD Modules	Wired	Products, Customers, Orders, and Store Settings pages are wired to real backend APIs (list/create/update/delete + store scoping).	Merchants/Platform RBAC admin UI pages are not built yet.
Dashboard	Partially wired -> improved	Dashboard now reads real Orders/Customers/Products APIs for stats, revenue series, category chart, and activity feed (removed mock dependency for these).	Advanced analytics pages still use mock data (Analytics/Marketing/StoreBuilder modules pending backend APIs).
API Base Binding	Improved	Frontend API client now defaults to runtime origin `/api` when `REACT_APP_API_BASE` is not set, and still supports explicit real API base via env.	Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE` in production when frontend/backend are on different domains.
Route Unification	Wired	Single recommended URL flow enforced: `/onboarding` redirects to `/auth/register`.	None.
