Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Onboarding Wizard UI	Developed	Final pass done for a more compact/professional onboarding look: same Sitesellr logo style (icon + wordmark), tighter spacing, cleaner typography, balanced split layout, and preserved 5-step wizard flow.	Need one browser screenshot QA pass from your target resolution/zoom for tiny 10-20px adjustments.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	Flow remains exact: Register -> Verify Email+Mobile OTP -> Choose Plan -> Payment(if paid) -> Setup Store -> Activate and redirect to admin.	Payment stage still placeholder confirmation (real gateway not integrated).
RBAC + Tenancy	Developed	Two-layer RBAC and tenant guards remain active from prior updates.	Audit logs + step-up auth for high-risk actions are pending.
