Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
RBAC/Merchants Unauthorized UX	Developed	Added explicit unauthorized handling for 401/403 in Platform RBAC and Merchants admin pages; UI now shows: "You are not authorized." instead of generic API errors.	None.
Platform RBAC + Merchants UI	Developed	Pages remain wired to real APIs and admin routes.	Role seeding still required for access.
