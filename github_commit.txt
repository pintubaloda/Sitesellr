Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
Onboarding Wizard UI	Developed	Reworked `/onboarding` layout to match requested left-step wizard structure (top nav, left progress rail, right form panel) while preserving Sitesellr theme/colors/logo usage.	Need final visual QA in deployed environment for exact spacing/typography parity on all screen sizes.
Onboarding Flow Logic	Developed	Existing register -> OTP verify -> plan -> payment(stub) -> setup store -> activate flow remains fully wired to backend APIs.	Payment step still stub (no real gateway capture yet).
RBAC + Tenancy	Developed	Two-layer RBAC (platform + store permission policies) and tenant guards are in place from previous update.	Need audit logs + step-up auth for high-risk operations.
