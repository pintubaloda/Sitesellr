Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Issue	Status	What's Done	What You Must Do on Render
SPA refresh shows Not Found	Fixed in config	Added static route rewrite in `render.yaml` for `sitesellr-web`: `/* -> /index.html` so React Router URLs work on refresh/direct hit.	Redeploy the Blueprint/static service so new `routes` config is applied.

Notes
- If service was created manually (not blueprint-managed), add this in Render Static Site settings:
  - Source: `/*`
  - Destination: `/index.html`
  - Action: `Rewrite`

Git state
- Last pushed commit: 3a4b4be
- Current SPA rewrite fix is local and pending push.
