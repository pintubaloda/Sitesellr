Sitesellr Requirement Status
Updated: 2026-02-18 (local)

Module	Status	What's Done	What's Pending / Partial
RBAC Foundation	Developed	Introduced two-layer RBAC: Platform roles (Owner/Staff) + Store permissions (claims-style keys like products.read/orders.write).	Need UI for permission management and full permission catalog coverage for all future modules.
Policy Enforcement	Developed	Replaced role-only checks with policy-based access requirements; added permission policies and platform policies.	Need step-up auth (re-auth/MFA) on high-risk actions (refund/payout/subscription override).
Tenant Isolation	Developed	Store APIs now require tenant context + store scoping checks and deny cross-store access.	Need global query-filter strategy for deeper hard guarantees across future repositories/services.
RBAC Admin APIs	Developed	Added platform RBAC admin endpoints to assign platform roles and per-store explicit permissions.	Need audit log persistence and approval workflow for sensitive role/permission changes.
Data Model + Migration	Developed	Added `platform_user_roles` and `store_user_permissions` models with migration + snapshot updates.	Need migration run in target environments (`dotnet ef database update`) and seed scripts.
Onboarding + Existing Modules	Partial	Onboarding flow remains active; core CRUD endpoints now guarded by permission policies.	Need broader module wiring (billing, refunds, payouts, logistics, marketplace apps) under same permission matrix.
